## About <a name = "about"></a>
This code was builded in "Research Pratice" class in CEFET-RJ. This hyperparameter optimization is based on the final paper called "Agrupamento Espectral Aplicado à Otimização de Hiperparâmetros de Aprendizado de Máquina". In this 
algorithm you have option to choose between zscore and minmax for normalization and kmeans and spectral clustering for clustering the hyperparameters. Supports csv and RData.
